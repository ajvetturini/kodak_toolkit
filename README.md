# kodak toolkit
This is a Python-based toolkit for creating simple 2D and 3D plots using Plotly as the backend. Specifically, this kodak
toolkit can be used alongside the kodak viewer ([link](https://ajvetturini.github.io/kodak/)) to visualize plots via a 
user-interface (UI) application.

This package is in **very** active development and it should be expected for code to change quite frequently. A stable
build will be released in the near future as more plot types are added. Below is a list of currently supported plot 
types in this package.

# Features
I am working on adding the Example scripts to this readme, but if you are interested in using kodak now please see the
Examples folder. Here are the current supported features of the kodak toolkit:

- A Vite-React enabled UI to editing figures / getting the size correct
- Interactable plotting elements 
- Uses a ".plots" (json) file which can easily be shared amongst collaborators to view figures
- Easy export to SVG / PNG for publications


# Requirements
- Python 3.9
- NumPy
- Plotly
